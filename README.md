A vscode theme that is visually appealing and accessible, specifically designed to enhance the coding experience for users with color vision deficiencies (protanomaly and deuteranomaly).
All the colours used are thoughtfully selected and reviewed ensuring 90% similarity for individuals with protanomaly and deuteranomaly.
